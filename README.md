## Laravel Learning Platform

I am extending a project from a TeamTreehouse course here to practice PHP in general and 
specifically the use of the Laravel framework.


#### Features that I added
* User management
* Filtering of courses by programming language and difficulty
* Added a model for tracks and related it with the course and user models
* Ability to start and complete tracks/courses
* Marking the current track as active on the user dashboard
* A ranked leaderboard based on courses completed
